# Parameter-Optimization-of-SVM
# Description
This project involves training and optimizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on a multi-class dataset. The aim is to explore how SVM parameters affect model performance and track the best results using multiple samples of the dataset. A convergence graph is generated to visualize the model's accuracy over iterative training.
# Objective
1.Select a multi-class dataset with a size between 5,000 to 30,000 rows from the UCI repository.
2.Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (70-30 split) for 10 different random samples.
3.Optimize the SVM parameters for each sample to achieve the best accuracy.
4.Track and report the best parameters and accuracies for all 10 samples.
5.Visualize the convergence of the SVM model using a graph that plots accuracy over iterations for the best sample.
6.Document and save the results for analysis and reproducibility.
